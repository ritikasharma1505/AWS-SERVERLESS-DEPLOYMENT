Do not give up if this seems messy, this is how you learn, make mistakes and find solutions (Google, chatGPT what serves you better..)

There were specific steps I messed up

Make sure :
Lambda function 'getStudents.py' has a specified 'region_name', update as per your convenience
Lambda functions are integrated correctly with API gateway as trigger, map will help you( I failed here to find this issue)
CORS is enabled to your created resources in API gateway
Re-Deploy API if any changes made specially after enabling CORS 
Update 'scripts.js" where API_ENDPOINT variable is 'API invoke URL' 
Lambda Existing Role, I created beforehand (Search IAM on Console Home > IAM Roles > Create Role > Usecase as Lambda > Attach policies like, AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess, AmazonAPIGatewayInvokeFullAccess,AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole > Give Role name > Create)
Allow Public access (By default: Block public access is enabled) and S3 bucket policy are required to be updated in case of direct hosting on S3 [not required in case of CloudFront integration]


Hope this helps !!
